Please do to following steps to run this test project

1.) Download and install latest wamp server
2.) Place formmanager folder in www directory
3.) Execute formmanager.sql script
4.) Visit http://localhost/formmanager/ ULR in browser

Please try to populate all visible inputs while testing the app, since I did not
implement validation on input fields. Also, I have intentionally left some code as
a trail that I was trying to do something.

Look forward to hear your feedback.
Thank you.
